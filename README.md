building an opensource collaborationtool for everyone: decentralizing productivity

The goal of this project is to create a platform which makes global collaboration possible. <br>
This task is not easy and will ask for a lot of passion!

My belief is that humans are naturally active, they don’t need the push of others to get out of bed and do what they like to do. However, if you know you will be forced to do something you don’t like, you won’t get out of bed that easy. 
As human interests seem to be highly diverse, most tasks should be covered by some of us. Sure, some machines will be required for the really shitty stuff, but I guess we would find someone to build these machines. <br>
To make that possible perfect collaboration is necessary and all tasks, which will not be made with pleasure by some human, and is vital to the survival of human kind, will be performed by a machine. Without tools to connect people and machines to do all the tasks we don’t like, this is not possible, but now in the 21st century global collaboration gets easier every minute.<br>Shouldn’t we give this development a small push?
