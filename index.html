		<h4>What is it?</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>A place where people can collaborate on projects</li>
				<li>Projects are created by the users</li>
				<li>fair payment is ensured by simple evaluations</li>
				<li>You can â€¦</li>
					<ul>
						<li>host and share your projects</li>
						<li>host, share and review files</li>
						<li>give and get -knowledge, -ideas, and -passion</li>
						<li>do what you always wanted to do</li>					
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="welcome-why">
			<h4>Why is it?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Collaboration is the key to human development</li>
				<li>If people do what they like to do, their productivity often exceeds expectations</li>
				<li>Giving every human the possibility to show what he/she can do, helps people to find their real passion (inducing happiness)</li>
				<li>The ongoing globalization requires a new approach to collaboration</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The old hierarchical way of organizing projects is outdated</li>
						<li>Worldwide collaboration is only possible if people see how dependent they are on each other</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There is no way anyone of us could build any of the modern high-tech machines etc. On his/her own. </li>
								<li>Every involved individuum in a project is thus necessary to make the project work</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Therefore no one should have the power to decide over someone else</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="welcome-how">
			<h4>How is it?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This is a basic-platform, which makes collaboration possible
				</li>
					
				<li>It gives you the opportunity to specify your passions (what makes you get out of bed without any external pressure), and create projects, or collaborate on projects of others. </li>
				<li>
					This is hopefully only the start of a long journey of human kind towards global collaboration.
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This platform will hopefully improve by being used</li>
						<li>
							All members are welcome to share their ideas, and beliefs about the platforms set-up etc.
						</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
